A simple BarMorph.
It shows a value within a given interval.
The bar that shows the value "grows" from my center.
Set the interval with #maxValue: and #minValue:
Set the value with #value:

Change the bar's color with #barColor:
Change the color that is shown behind the bar with #backColor:'

This Morph is used e.g. in PhdETMotorControl
