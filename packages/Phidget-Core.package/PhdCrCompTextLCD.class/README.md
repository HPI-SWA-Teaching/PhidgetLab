I am a special Phidget Component that can display texts on a LCD display.

There are different values that can be retrieved and set:
	- contrast: integer between 0 and 255 representing the current display contrast.
	- isBacklightOn: boolean. If it is true, the display's backlight is enabled.
	- isCursorOn: a boolean. If it is true, a cursor is shown after the last written character.
	- isCursorBlinking: a bollean. If it is true, the cursor is blinking.

I currently only belong to PhdCrTextLCD.
