I am a simple launcher for recent projects.

EToysLauncher new openInHand

- I find latest ten projects in "My Squeak" and image directories (see: EToysLauncher>>directories).
- A thumbnail can be shown if there is "project name.gif" file.
- You can enter a project when you click a thumbnail.
- The list is updated when you go and back project.
